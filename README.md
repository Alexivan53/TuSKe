# TuSKe - Skript Addon

## Archivied - 26/01/22

As everyone already noticed, TuSKe it's no longer supported.

As I'm far from development, I'm bit outdated with the community, so I don't know currently which Skript's supported versions, but probably TuSKe doesn't work for the newest versions of Bukkit and Skript, and it won't receive any update at mean time.

If you need help with TuSKe, I can't guarantee, but I will let few useful links for known Skript communities which can help you for sure.

If you are a developer, you are free to maintain or use any code that might be useful.

Thank's for everyone support, I will be in touch in the future.
